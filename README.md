# Authentication & Authorization & SSO Integration & IAM

> An ongoing & curated collection of awesome  AuthN+Z software, libraries and frameworks, best guidelines and technical resources and cool stuff about Authentication & Authorization & SSO & IAM.

[Authentication (aka AuthN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication) and [authorization (aka AuthZ)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorization) are both security measures. Authentication is the process of verifying who you are. Authorization is the process of verifying that you have access to something. Authorization occurs after successful authentication.

Authorization 
> Access priviledges granted to a user, program, or process
